# Project1_AI_Search
This is a project in the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at HCMUS.  
This project aims to build an interactive application to help visualize the behaviour of these algorithms via Rush Hour Game:  
- Breadth-First Search.
- Depth-First Search.
- Uniform-Cost Search.
- A* Search.

Rush Hour Game is a classic game where the target vehicle must escape a traffic jam through some searching strategy. The project is implemented in Python with Pygame library as the main library for visualization.

The performance of each algorithm is measured in 3 metrics:  
- Search time.
- Memory usage.
- Number of nodes generated.

The statistics of the game is presented real time in the screen to make it easy to follow.
